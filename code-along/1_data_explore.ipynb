    "\n",
    "Features often have different scales. Look at the summary statistics above; `smoothness_mean` ranges from 0.05 to 0.16, whereas `area` goes from 143.5 to 2501. Some machine learning algorithms find it difficult to compare features that range over such different magnitudes. Features whose units are larger can swamp the predictive space and have a disproportionately greater affect upon the predictions made by the algorithm. To combat this, we rescale the data so that all the features vary over the same range. We do this with the `RobustScaler()` class imported from scikit-learn."
